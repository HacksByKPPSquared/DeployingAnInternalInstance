# # 🚀 Lab 05 - Deploying an Internal Instance

Welcome to **My Lab**where we take our cloud-building skills to the next level! In this mission, we deploy internal instances, configure flavors, and get those instances up and running like a well-oiled machine. Spoiler: It's way more fun than it sounds! 😎💻

## 🌟 What Went Down:

1. **Instance Management**:  
   Spun up instances faster than I could brew coffee. With some help from the Horizon dashboard, we deployed, checked details, and even deleted instances like seasoned pros. ☕💨

2. **Image Inspection**:  
   Checked out our *rhel17* and *flavor2* images, because nothing screams "cloud admin" like analyzing images and their attributes. 📸💾

3. **Flavors: Not Just for Ice Cream 🍦**:  
   Created, modified, and deleted *flavor2* and *m1.exercise* like they were going out of style. Flavor management is key when it comes to scaling instances to your exact specs!

4. **Networking for the Win**:  
   Set up *net2* and renamed it to *net3*, because why not? Navigated subnets, deleted networks, and ensured smooth traffic flow in our virtual playground. 🌐

5. **Instance 5 Is Alive! (For Now)**:  
   Created *instance5* and took it for a spin. Then, like any responsible admin, I deleted it when its time was up. RIP *instance5*. 👋

6. **PAUSED, SHUTOFF, ACTIVE**:  
   Mastered the OpenStack trifecta: pausing, shutting off, and reactivating instances like a cloud control wizard. 🧙‍♂️

7. **Goodbye, *rhel7-instance* 👋**:  
   When the fun was over, we cleaned up the environment by deleting *rhel7-instance*. Gone, but not forgotten!

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade:

- **Horizon Dashboard**: The command center for managing instances, images, and more. 🖥️
- **Flavors**: Custom configurations for your instances. Not the tasty kind, but just as essential. 🍦
- **OpenStack CLI**: For when you're ready to flex your command-line muscles and control instances with pure power. 💪

## 🌈 Why This Lab Matters:

Deploying and managing instances in OpenStack is essential for cloud architects. Understanding how to configure instances, flavors, and networks allows you to create scalable, flexible environments. Plus, it's just plain fun when you get to say you *paused* and *shut down* your own cloud! 🌤️☁️

💡 **Pro-tip**: Always double-check your instance status with `openstack server list`. There's nothing worse than thinking an instance is paused when it's actually running wild. 🦁
